      <description>tp-keyboard ! The goal of this project is to make a useable desktop keyboard from the keyboard of the ThinkPad L420 laptop and making the trackpoint functional.
I originally started this project back in early 2020 where I spent alot of time decoding the Keyboard matrix and figuring out the pinout of the trackpoint module. I created a breakout board to easily access the pins of the keyboards FFC cable which made it easier to work with while decoding the matrix.</description>

      <description>After 7 years my Early 2015 Macbookâ€™s battery was barely working and on its last legs. After getting a new battery from iFixit I opened my MacBook and replaced it. I booted it up and noticed there was a bunch of smudges / damage on the screen. I realized that some of the alcohol I used during the installation process sept through the keyboard and got onto the screen and caused damage.</description>
