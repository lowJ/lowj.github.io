      <description>After 7 years my Early 2015 Macbookâ€™s battery was barely working and on its last legs. After getting a new battery from iFixit I opened my MacBook and replaced it. I booted it up and noticed there was a bunch of smudges / damage on the screen. I realized that some of the alcohol I used during the installation process sept through the keyboard and got onto the screen and caused damage.</description>
